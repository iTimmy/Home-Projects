See if you can make export data not make duplicates or set order ID to be unique.

I feel like I could've implemented this in a better way where the order number
is assigned right when the user adds an order, but rather, the order number is
generated when the user exports the order (which is in when it goes through the service layer).
Because in this way, when the user decides to edit their order, they can see the order number
associated with the customer, so that if there are other orders with the same name
as displayed in the console, they would know which customer name that they are editing.
But for the sake of time and getting this project done, I may leave this out for a few.

RESOLUTIONS:
Duplicate orders. Why?
RESOLVED: While creating a proper function which is updateOrders(Order order), addOrder() and editOrder()
are no longer sharing. For instance, editOrder() in the controller layer would reference addOrder() so then
it is less redudant in prompting the user for info. Now, it no longer references.


Assure that when displaying orders, it's coming straight from the file rather than the hashmap,
because you can display the orders and then export them. You're not supposed to do that.
RESOLVED: I created a separate hashmap variable called loadOrders, so that the current orders that have
just been added to the hasmhamp via the add order option would not be interfered while choosing the
option to display orders.
