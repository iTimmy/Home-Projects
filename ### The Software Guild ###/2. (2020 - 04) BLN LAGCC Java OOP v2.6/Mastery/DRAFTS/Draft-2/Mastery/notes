DELETE TEXT FILE IF EMPTY

FIX THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STATE INVALID & STATE UNAVAILABLE

VALIDATION:
Order of date does not exist if you try to display or remove an order from that file
When adding to a new file, there are two of the fucking same IDs. Why?
When you display, then add, it adds the new customer and the ones displayed. Why?



BONUS:
KeyCodes for ESC and ENTER...
See if you can make export data not make duplicates or set order ID to be unique.

I feel like I could've implemented this in a better way where the order number
is assigned right when the user adds an order, but rather, the order number is
generated when the user exports the order (which is in when it goes through the service layer).
Because in this way, when the user decides to edit their order, they can see the order number
associated with the customer, so that if there are other orders with the same name
as displayed in the console, they would know which customer name that they are editing.
But for the sake of time and getting this project done, I may leave this out for a few.
